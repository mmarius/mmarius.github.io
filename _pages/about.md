I am postdoctoral researcher at the [Language Science and Technology Department](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/department/lst.html) of [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html). 

Before that, I did my PhD in Computer Science at [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html) where I was also a member of the [SFB 1102: Information Density and Linguistic Encoding](http://www.sfb1102.uni-saarland.de/). My PhD advisor was [Dietrich Klakow](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=_HtGYmoAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

The overarching goal of my research is to build natural language processing (NLP) systems that are *well understood*, *robust*, *adaptable*, and *accessible*; we should have a rigorous understanding of when and why NLP systems work or fail, they should be robustly deployable in a variety of real-world scenarios with guarantees about their performance and generalization, they should be easy to adapt to new domains and problems, and they should be accessible by and useful to everyone.
