I am a postdoctoral fellow at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/) and a researcher at [Mila - Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/) in Montr√©al :canada:. 
<!-- I am a member of the [McGill NLP group](https://mcgill-nlp.github.io/). -->

Before that, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [Language Science and Technology Department](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/department/lst.html) of [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html) :de:, where I also did my PhD in Computer Science. My PhD advisor was [Dietrich Klakow](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=_HtGYmoAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

The overarching goal of my research is to build natural language processing (NLP) systems that are **well understood**, **robust**, and **adaptable**; we should have a rigorous understanding of when and why NLP systems work or fail, they should be robust in a variety of real-world scenarios with guarantees about their performance and generalization, and they should be easy to adapt to new domains and problems. 

For our work, my collaborators and I have received a Best Paper Award at COLING 2022, the Best Theme Paper Award at ACL 2023, and the Most Interesting Paper Award at the BabyLM Challenge 2023 :trophy:.

In my free time, I enjoy CrossFit :weight_lifting_man:, playing soccer :soccer:, and baking :cake:.
