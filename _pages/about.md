I am a second year PhD student at the [Language Science and Technology Department](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/department/lst.html) of [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html). I am also a member of the [Saarbrücken Graduate School of Computer Science](https://www.graduateschool-computerscience.de/) and the [SFB 1102: Information Density and Linguistic Encoding](http://www.sfb1102.uni-saarland.de/). My advisor is [Dietrich Klakow](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=_HtGYmoAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

My research is concerned with representation learning and multi-modal machine learning in the field of natural language processing (NLP). In particular, I’m interested in how we can learn better representations of natural language by leveraging world knowledge. Further, I am generally interested in providing a better understanding of machine learning applied to NLP.
